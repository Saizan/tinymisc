Right now just a bibliography.  If you have helpful notes (maybe in org-mode?
I like org-mode but I have yet to get a workflow going that gets along with
BibTeX ...) on these articles I will take your pull requests or give you commit
rights ...

If you wonder why there are only dead symlinks in 'readings/', you will need
to get git-annex installed and 'git-annex get readings' and that (mostly) does
it.
